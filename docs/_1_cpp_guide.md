# C++ study guide
This guide assumes that you have background in at least one programming language. It gives you check-lists of concepts and directions to learn C\++. After following this guide, you should be able to: read and understand a most of C\++ programs, using C\++ libraries, and start developing your own program or library.

* Basic syntax: C\++ programming language is based on C programming language. The basic C\++ syntax is actually C syntax. There is a lot of tutorials in the internet that you can study. However, you should be able to understand the following concepts:

Operators:
*  arithmetic E.g.  (+-*/) (++, --)
*  condition (==, !=)
*  assignment (=, +=, *=),
*  logic (! && || )
*  array, structure and pointer ( [], ->, . )

Loop (for,while,do),
Condition (if,switch),
other keywords (void,NULL)

* Basic C\++ tools: To be able to develop a C\++ program or library, you needs a C++ tool set. (It contains at least a compiler, a linker, and standard libraries; and optionally an IDE.) You can start with GCC, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Xcode. However, I strongly recommend GCC in a Linux machine (or virtual machine) to start with.

After installation of your C\++ tool set, you need to be able to compile and run the "Hello world!" program.

* use a C\++ library
* write a function

More advanced
* Bit operations
* Basic generic (template)
